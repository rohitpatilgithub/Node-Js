## üß© What is Nodemon Package ?
> Nodemon package automatically restarts your Node.js server when changes are detected in project

## üåï Why we use it ?
> We have to restart the server by manually closing it down and restarting the server whenever changes are made in our project <br>
> Thus Nodemon has sole purpose of making things automated and restarting the server

## üî∞ How to install Nodemon in our project ?
1. Open terminal in your current directory

2. Run the cmd to install __Nodemon__
```bash
npm i -D nodemon 
```
here we added ```-D``` before nodemon because it is a devDependency

3. Now you will be able to see the nodemon in devDependencies of package.json
```bash

(package.json)

{
    "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.10"
    }
}
```

4. After installation of nodemon package we should make sure that our ```scripts``` section in package.json is updated with our respective file
```bash

(package.json)

{
   "scripts": {
      "start": "node filename.js"
    }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why we wrote ```-D``` and why is it in devDependency not normal dependency ?
We wrote ```-D``` flag to explicitly add the nodemon in development dependency because it is not a package which is required during production but required during development which saves our time of restarting server during development
