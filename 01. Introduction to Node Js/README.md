## 🌕 Why Node.js exists ?
> Javascript cannot communicate with database directly due to security reasons
and Javascript is at browser level be it frameworks like Angular , Vue , React , Next
> <br> We won't be able to communicate with database directly thus we need Node.js as middle man
> Node.js is meant to make a Javascript file executable outside browser becuase Node.js provides us the runtime environment

## 🌕 Things you should know !
> 1. Javascript is client side language
> 2. Node.js is server side environment

## 🌕 What is Node.js for ?
> 1. Node.js does connect our Javascript with database <br>
> 2. Node.js actually brings our Javascript on server side
> 3. Node.js helps us to play with data (insert, fetch, update, delete) from our database
> 4. Front-End ➡️ Node.js ➡️ DataBase

## 🌕 What Node.js actually does ?
> We know Node.js is server side language thus it has these privileges
> 1. Request data from Database directly
> 2. Manipulate (insert,update,delete) the data from Database
> 3. Sends the manipulated data back as response

## 🌕 How it works like how!!!
> See Node.js acts as middle man between front-end and back-end <br>
> Manipulated data is sent as response to " Front-End " <br>
> I've put Emphasis on Front-End which is to clarify that our data manipulation with Node.js directly works with database <br>
> Only thing which is explicitly changed is " Front-End " as response

<br>

> ___Inshort , Node.js + Database => Back-End handles the data manipulation___ <br>
> ___Front-End displays the updated data___
